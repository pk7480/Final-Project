SpaceX EDX SQL Server
Objectives

Writing and executing SQL queries to solve the questions being asked.
The dataset used to be queried can be found below.

In many cases the dataset to be analyzed is available as a .CSV (comma separated values) file, perhaps on the internet. Click on the link below to download and save the dataset (.CSV file):

SpaceX DataSet
Connect to the database

Let us first load the SQL extension and establish a connection with the database

As  IBM's DB2 guidelines on this notebook doesnt work I will implement the SQL queries using my normal Microsoft SQL Server instance using my own library  'sqlserver' for other info on my libary visit https://github.com/ADGVLOGS/pythonsqlserverclass

!pip install sqlserver
